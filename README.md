Question 1:
We have a bunch of employees. Each employee gets a commission every month, so 12
commissions a year.
You need to create data for about 100 employees, with names like “Employee1”, “Employee2”.
The commission for each month can be a random amount between 1000 and 5000. Find the
Top 5 people with the highest average commission
Hint: Use an array to store commission for each month of the year
